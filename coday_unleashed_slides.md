## 🧠 Effective Agent-ic work

### 👍 Rule of thumbs

[Prompting Strategies](docs/05-working-effectively/prompting-strategies.md)
- your context = fast & ~~furious~~ plentiful: STT, copy-paste, dactylo++
- attitude: directive vs open, reverse questions
- mega-prompt vs multi-turn: problem size & iterative-ness

[Agent Tooling](docs/05-working-effectively/agent-tooling.md)
- MCPs everywhere
- project scripts quickwin
- adjust tools to agent model and role

[Agent Design](docs/05-working-effectively/agent-design.md)
- Role/Domain/Task/Perspective
- instructions: structure job post
- delegation: agent hierarchy & guidelines

Bonus:
- [Context and Memory](docs/05-working-effectively/context-and-memory.md)
- [Detecting Hallucinations](docs/05-working-effectively/detecting-hallucinations.md)

## 🔁 Chapter session (60min)

Per chapter:
- select a ticket (good, bad, whatever)
- zoom back on the ticket with/out Coday: which agent(s), what expectations, how, etc...
- while time, try different approaches (or tickets)
- reflect and use Coday to reflect on quality/efficiency of the attempts

## 🎤 Tentative mob conclusion (10min)

👉 What did you learn, want to put forward, want for later ? 👈

Doc Coday, again and again...
Noob feeling, learn by doing
Do share even "common sense" feedbacks
Agent JIRA <-> other agents ?
Naming convention for agent iterations (Dev_2, Dev_next, next_dev ?) prefix/suffix
Agent evolution assessment (testing, evals, ?)
PR history = test data for agents
Reliance on feedbacks (=> need feature...)

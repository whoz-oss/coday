# 🔌 Integrations

Coday can interface with different APIs and tools through integrations. Each type has its own configuration requirements
and setup process.

## 🛠️ Project Integrations

These integrations are configured per project through `config integration user` at user level or `config integration project` to set it at project-level (⚠️ will be used by all users on the project). Then follow the instructions.

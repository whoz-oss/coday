# What is Coday?

Coday is a lightweight agentic framework designed to help developers work with AI agents on existing, scoped projects. It provides as much autonomy as desired through contextual understanding and tool integration, while remaining agnostic to AI providers and deployment environments.

## Core Philosophy

Coday runs locally and interfaces with various AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and tools to provide a comprehensive assistance experience, from simple queries to fully autonomous work capabilities. The framework emphasizes:

- **Conversation-first**: Natural dialogue with AI agents through a modern web interface
- **Project-scoped**: Works within the context of your existing codebase
- **Provider-agnostic**: Switch between AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) without changing your workflow
- **Extensible**: Native tools and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations

## Key Features

- **Web Interface**: Modern browser-based interface with rich formatting and features
- **Configurable Agents**: Define custom agents with specific roles, prompts, and tools
- **Three-level Configuration**: User, Project, and Coday-level settings
- **Memory System**: Agents can remember important information across conversations
- **Tool Integration**: Built-in tools plus MCP protocol support for extensibility

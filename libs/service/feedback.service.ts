- are there outdated or irrelevant memories you can remove ?
- are there duplicated memories that would benefit a merge ?

Use the memory tools, and only if obviously necessary:

- when less than 5 memories present, do not curate.
- between 10 and 20 memories, look for simplification.
- over 40 memories, time for significant cleanup !
